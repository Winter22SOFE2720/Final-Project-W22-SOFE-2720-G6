# Online Supermarket Project

## Project description
Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, our store has seen a dramatic decrease in recent sales due to people being quarantined and overall not feeling safe to leave their homes.
This website was created in response to that situation, and will hopefully attract more attention to our store.
It allows customers to see what products we have low in stock and get delivered fresh groceries all in the comfort of their own homes.
The website will also contain our weekly digital flyer, showcasing discounts on our products that will get more customers to shop with us.
